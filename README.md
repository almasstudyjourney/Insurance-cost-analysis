# [Practice Project - Data Analytics for Insurance Cost Data Set](https://www.ibm.com)

This repository contains the project completed as part of the "[Data Analysis with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python)" course, which is a requirement for the [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) Data Science Certificate program.

## Project Overview
The project involves performing analytical operations on an insurance database that includes various parameters to understand insurance costs better.

## Objectives:
- **Perform Data Analytics** on the insurance dataset.
- **Clean and Preprocess Data**: Handle missing values and convert data types.
- **Visualize Data**: Uncover insights about insurance charges based on different factors.
- **Document Findings**: Share the analysis and insights through a well-documented Jupyter Notebook.

## Structure of the Repository:
1. `Medical_insurance.csv/` - Contains the insurance dataset used for the analysis.
2. `Insurance_cost_Analysis.ipynb/` - Includes the Jupyter Notebook with code and analysis.
3. `README.md` - Overview of the project.
